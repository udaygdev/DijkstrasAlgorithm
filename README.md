# DijkstrasAlgorithm
A project inspired by CS344: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF COMPUTER ALGORITHMS and MATH428: GRAPH THEORY at Rutgers University.

This project will be in C for manual memory allocation and deallocation. The goal of this project is for the program to be able to take in a text file with details about a graph and find the cheapest path from a single source to all other vertices. For simplicity, I will assume that this graph is directed. It will output all weights for each vertex and the cheapest paths from the source to every other vertex.
